## Machine Learning Setup

Please prepare your model in either the `.h5` or saved model format. Place your model in the same folder as the `main.py` file. You will load your model in the code provided below. There are two options available: one for image-based input and another for text-based input. You need to complete either the `def predict_text` or `def predict_image` functions in `main.py` based on your model's input type.


## Usage

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your machine learning model:
- If you have an `.h5` model file, place it in the same folder as `main.py`.
- If you have a saved model format, place it in a folder named `my_model_folder` in the same directory as `main.py`.

4. Read the `main.py` file carefully

5. Run the server:
```sh
python main.py
```
